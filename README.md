## Why Did I Build This?

Welcome to the Savannah University Directory, a project born out of the excitement to tackle real-world challenges and make a meaningful impact. As a college student, I discovered a unique opportunity to create something valuable â€“ a user-friendly university directory that goes beyond the ordinary.

### Key Features

- **Home Frontend (React):** A sleek and intuitive user interface crafted with React for a seamless experience.
- **Database using AWS RDS (MySQL):** Leveraging the power of AWS RDS and MySQL for robust and scalable data management.
- **Admin Dashboard:** An administrative hub to efficiently manage and organize directory information.
- **API Creation:** Crafting APIs to ensure smooth communication and data flow within the system.

## Tools Used

I utilized a diverse set of tools and technologies to bring this project to life:

- **AWS RDS:** For reliable and scalable database management.
- **Bootstrap:** Ensuring a responsive and visually appealing design.
- **Radix UI:** Enhancing user interface components for a polished look.
- **React Router:** Enabling seamless navigation within the application.
- **Node.js and Express:** Building a robust backend to support the frontend functionality.
- **Rest API:** Facilitating communication between different components of the system.
- **Vite:** A fast and efficient build tool to streamline the development process.
- **Env Files:** Managing environment variables for a secure and flexible configuration.
- **Formik and Yup:** Simplifying form handling and validation.
- **AG Grid:** A powerful grid component for managing and displaying data effectively.

## Challenges Faced

During the development journey, several challenges emerged, prompting creative solutions:

- **State Management:** Ensuring data is displayed at the right time, especially during application start-up and updates.
- **Component Structure:** Breaking down the UI into a component structure that enhances the development process.
- **Entity Information Update:** Handling scenarios where entity information needs updating even when a form is not fully filled.
- **Database Costs:** Initially implemented directly with an Amazon MySQL RDS. Upon further research, I adopted PlanetScale, which still uses an Amazon MySQL RDS, with the incredible benefit of being free.

I hope this directory proves to be a valuable resource for Savannah University, offering a seamless and efficient way to access and manage information. Feel free to explore, contribute, and make it even better!
